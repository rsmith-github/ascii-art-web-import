# ascii-art-web

The ascii art project, modified to work in a web page.

Created by Nikolay, Remi, and Maya.

A web application written in Go, HTML, and CSS which allows users to generate ascii-art text based on their inputs. ¡INPUT HOW ALRGORITHM WORKS HERE!

Execute "go run ." in the terminal and then load up http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Upon loading, select a text style you would like your ASCII art to have from the radio buttons, and type the text you would like to turn in to ASCII art in the textbox below. Select the submit button once you are happy with your choices to see your artwork.

¡CREATE A TEST FILE FOR THIS!
To test the code, please execute "go run test.go" in the terminal. You do not have to run the server to do this. If successful, the result "ok" shall be printed in the terminal.

The currently available styles are: Standard, Shadow, and Tinkertoy.
